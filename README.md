**Dear Chairs and Reviewers,**

  We kindly thank all the reviewers for their time and for providing valuable feedback on our work.

  In response to the reviewers, we have added this **`supplementary_files.pdf`** file. This file contains our supplementary experiments, including **comparisons of generated image quality**, **analyses of stereotype neuron distributions**, and **validation experiments on the effectiveness of state-of-the-art models**. Additionally, it provides responses to reviewer questions that we were unable to address in the rebuttal cell due to character limitations.

Kind regards,

The authors
